# factorio-alien-economy-light
A mod for factorio [Link to mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alien-economy)

Light version of [Alien Loot Economy](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alien-economy) by [sensenmann](https://mods.factorio.com/user/sensenmann), that only contains modules, ammo and base materials, and excludes gun turret, solar panels etc. This improves compatibility with other mods like Bob's Logistics and Factorio Extended (Plus).

Includes functionality and settings from [Alien Loot Economy Rampant Compatibility Fix](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/rampant-alienmodule-compat) by [KilowattSquall](https://mods.factorio.com/user/KilowattSquall) to add compatibility with Rampant without the need for an extra mod.

Uses same settings as Alien Loot Economy and Alien Loot Economy Rampant Compatibility Fix.

Not compatible with Alien Loot Economy.
